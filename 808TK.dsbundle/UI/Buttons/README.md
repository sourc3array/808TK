# WHAT ARE BUTTONS?

Buttons are image files used by the Decent Sampler engine to create the user interface (UI) controls for some of the **808TK** kit presets.

 - The Decent Sampler platform supports custom button graphics in JPEG or PNG format.

# USING BUTTONS

The **808TK** includes one (1) set of original switch designs which are used in the UI of the 'Portland' kit preset to provide switching functionality for the cymbal effects.

To use custom images as buttons, simply add the files to the 'Buttons' folder and update your instument preset file(s) accordingly using a text editor.
