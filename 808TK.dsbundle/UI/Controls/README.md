# What Are Controls?

User **controls** are the graphic knob files used by the Decent Sampler engine to create the user interface (UI) controls for the **808TK** instrument presets. 

 - The Decent Sampler platform supports custom JPEG or PNG control graphics in [KnobMan]( https://www.g200kg.com/knobman/ ) format.

# Using Controls
