# WHAT ARE BUTTONS?

Buttons are image files used by the *Decent Sampler* engine to create user interface (UI) controls for all of the **Bare Bones XS** virtual instrument presets.


# USING BUTTONS

**Bare Bones XS** includes two (2) sets of original switch designs for use with the *Decent Sampler* engine. Switches are used in the UI to provide on/off functionality for controls and feature an illuminated LED to indicate control status.

To use a custom image as a button, simply add the file to the 'Buttons' folder and update your instument preset file(s) accordingly using a text editor.
