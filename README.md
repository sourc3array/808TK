## Compatibility

The **808TK** is designed for use with SFZ sample players and audio plug-ins.

## Installation

1.  Download the free **808 Tape** sample library from *Wave Alchemy*:

    https://www.wavealchemy.co.uk/product/808-tape/

2.  Open the 'genAudio_808TK_SFZ' folder and populate the empty 'Samples' folder with the sample files located in the 'wa_808_tape' folder from *Wave Alchemy*.

3.  Load the instrument file 'genAudio_808TK.sfz' into your SFZ plug-in or stand-alone player.

## 808TK Overview

The **808TK** features fifty-three (53) 24-bit drum samples layered over sixteen (16) individual sound pads. The sound bank has been curated for optimal use with 4x4 drum pad controllers and finger drumming:

  - **DRUMS**: Kick (Sub), Kick, Low Tom and High Tom
  - **SNARES**: Snare, Snare (Alt), Rim and Clap
  - **HI-HATS**: Closed Hat, Closed Hat (Alt), Mid Hat and Open Hat
  - **CYMBALS**: Crash and Crash (Alt)
  - **PERCUSSION**: Clave and Maracas (FX)

Each drum pad contains multiple velocity layers to provide clean, saturated and driven variations for each sound. The velocity ranges follow a non-linear progression, pushing the drive articulations into the upper velocity range. This gives the drum kit a *sweet spot* at higher volumes that plays like the power band of an internal combustion engine. Several pads feature additional sample layers and sound design nuances, giving the **808TK** its unique sonic texture. All pads feature an independent Volume control, with an additional Tight control for the hi-hats. Muting has been implemented for each cymbal for enhanced realism and playability.

## Controls

The **808TK** provides controls for:

  - (V) **Volume**: Sets the volume for each individual pad
  - (T) **Tight**: Varies the openness of the Mid Hat

### Continuous Controllers

Controls are assigned to MIDI CCs for automation in DAWs, linking to hardware MIDI controllers, live performance, etc. See the [Continuous Controller IDs](#continuous-controller-ids) section below for a complete list of CC IDs and their assignments.

## Customization

TBD

## MIDI Reference
