## 808TK Overview

The **808TK** features fifty-three (53) 24-bit drum samples layered over sixteen (16) individual sound pads. The sound bank has been curated for optimal use with 4x4 drum pad controllers and finger drumming:

  - **DRUMS**: Kick (Sub), Kick, Low Tom, and High Tom
  - **SNARES**: Snare, Snare (Alt), Rim, and Clap
  - **HI-HATS**: Closed Hat, Closed Hat (Alt), Mid Hat, and Open Hat
  - **CYMBALS**: Crash and Crash (Alt)
  - **PERCUSSION**: Clave and Maracas (FX)

Multiple sound layers per pad with independent volume controls enable you to blend sounds to create unique sonic textures. Each drum pad contains multiple velocity layers to provide clean, saturated and driven variations for each sound. Round-robin sampling and non-linear sound design keep beats from sounding robotic. Switches provide a Loose/Tight option for the Hi-Hats and a Fast/Slow release option for the Cymbals.

***

## Controls

The **808TK** provides controls for:

  - **Volume**: Five (5) Drum Groups with independent Volume controls for Sound Layers A and B. 
  - **Loose/Tight Switch**: Varies the sample used for the Mid Hat and the release time for the Open Hat.
  - **Fast/Slow Switch**: Varies the release time for the Cymbals.
